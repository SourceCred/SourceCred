# List of commits that `git blame` should ignore.
#
# Include ONLY commits that are known to be no-ops, like automated
# reformattings.
#
# To properly format an entry, run
#
#     git show --no-patch --format='%H  # %s' COMMIT_HASH
#
# replacing `COMMIT_HASH` with the appropriate hash, or pass similar
# formatting to `git log`, etc.
#
# To teach your Git client to read this file, run
#
#     git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs
#
# (with Git 2.23+). See `git help blame` `git help config` for details.
