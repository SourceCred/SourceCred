/**
 * This module has a core data type identifying SourceCred identities.
 *
 * The scope for this data type is to model:
 * - a unique identifier for each identity
 * - a unique (renameable) identityName they choose
 * - the address of every node they correspond to in the graph
 *
 * Unlike most other state in SourceCred, the Identity state is
 * nondeterministically generated by SourceCred itself, and then persisted
 * long-term within the instance.
 *
 * This is in contrast to Graph data, which usually comes from an external
 * source, and is not persisted long-term, but instead is re-generated when
 * needed.
 *
 * In particular, this kernel of identity data is stored within the core ledger,
 * since it's necessary to track consistently when tracking Grain distribution.
 * This type should not grow to include all the data that the UI will
 * eventually want to show; that should be kept in a different data store which
 * isn't being used as a transaction ledger.
 *
