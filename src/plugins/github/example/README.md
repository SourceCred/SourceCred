# DemoData Instructions

This folder contains example data for testing the GitHub plugin. The example
data is generated by running our GitHub API fetch against the SourceCred
example repo at https://github.com/sourcecred/example-github/.

The demo data should be regenerated any time either the example repository or
the GitHub api query changes. To regenerate the demo data, run the following
command:

```shell
$ GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here" src/plugins/github/fetchGithubRepoTest.sh -u
```

You can also just verify that the data is up-to-date by running:
```shell
$ GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token_here" src/plugins/github/fetchGithubRepoTest.sh
```

There is a known issue where GitHub's end cursor output depends on your current
timezone. The example data is canonically generated from the US/Pacific
timezone.
