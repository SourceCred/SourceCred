# The initiatives plugin

Initiatives are proposals to improve SourceCred in some way.
Initiatives will be a focal point for minting new cred and flowing it to contributors.

The current format for them is as a Discourse topic, set as a wiki.
Using a specific template to format them, the wiki is used to link to it's own status and edges.
