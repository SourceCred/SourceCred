/**
 * This module contains the Graph, which is one of the most fundamental pieces
 * of SourceCred. SourceCred uses this graph to model all of the contributions
 * that make up a project, and the relationships between those contributions.
 *
 * If you aren't familiar with computer science graphs, now would be a good
 * time to refresh. See [this StackOverflow answer][1] for an introduction, and
 * [Wikipedia][2] for a more thorough overview. This Graph is used by
 * SourceCred as a "Contribution Graph", where every node is a contribution or
 * contributor (e.g. a pull request, or a GitHub user identity) and every edge
 * represents a connection between contributions or contributors (e.g. a pull
 * request contains a comment, or a comment is authored by a user).
 *
 * [1]: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/168058/what-are-graphs-in-laymens-terms#168067
 * [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)
 *
 * The Graph serves a simple function: it keeps track of which Nodes exist, and
 * what Edges join those nodes to each other. Nodes and Edges are both identified
 * by Addresses; specifically, `NodeAddressT`s and `EdgeAddressT`s.
 *
 * In both cases, addresses are modeled as arrays of strings. For example,
 * you might want to give an address to your favorite node. You can do so as
 * follows:
 *
 * const myAddress: NodeAddressT = NodeAddress.fromParts(["my", "favorite"])
 *
 * Edge Addresses are quite similar, except you use the EdgeAddress module.
 *
 * We model addresses as arrays of strings so that plugins can apply
 * hierarchical namespacing for the address. In general, for any address, the
 * first piece should be the name of the organization that owns the plugin, and
 * the second piece should be the name of the plugin. Pieces thereafter are
 * namespaced by the plugin's internal logic. For example, SourceCred has a
 * Git plugin, and that plugin produces addresses like
 * ["sourcecred", "git", "commit", "9cba0e9e212a287ce26e8d7c2d273e1025c9f9bf"].
 *
 * This enables "prefix matching" for finding only certain types of nodes. For
 * example, if we wanted to find every Git commit in the graph, we
 * could use the following code:
 *
 * const commitPrefix = NodeAddress.fromParts(["sourcecred", "git", "commit"]);
 * const commitNodes = graph.nodes({prefix: commitPrefix});
 *
 * In the case of a node, the address is all the graph knows about. If you have
 * any other metadata you want to store about the node—like its commit message
 * or its favorite color—you can store that in another database. The Graph is
 * just a graph, not a key value store.
 *
 * Edges need a little more data, since the graph needs to know what nodes the
 * edge connects. Each edge is an object with `src` and `dst` fields. These
 * fields represent the "source" of the edge and the "destination" of the edge
 * respectively, and both fields contain `NodeAddressT`s. The edge also has
 * its own address, which is an `EdgeAddressT`.
 * Here's a toy example:
 *
 * const pr = NodeAddress.fromParts(["pull_request", "1"]);
 * const me = NodeAddress.fromParts(["user", "decentralion"]);
 * const authored = EdgeAddress.fromParts(["authored", "pull_request", "1"]);
 * const edge = {src: me, dst: pr, address: authored};
 *
 * Creating a graph is as simple as invoking the constructor and adding nodes and edges:
 *
 * const g = new Graph();
 * g.addNode(pr);
 * g.addNode(me);
 * g.addEdge(edge);
 *
 * Graph has a number of accessor methods:
 * - `hasNode` to check if a node is in the Graph
 * - `nodes` to iterate over the nodes in the graph
 * - `hasEdge` to check if an edge address is in the Graph
 * - `edge` to retrieve an edge by its address
 * - `edges` to iterate over the edges in the graph
 * - `neighbors` to find all the edges and nodes adjacent to a node
 *    (also supports filtering by direction, by node prefix, or edge prefix)
 *
 * The Graph also has a few other convenience methods, like toJSON/fromJSON
 * for serialization, and `Graph.merge` for combining multiple graphs.
