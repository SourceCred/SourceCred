## SourceCred

SourceCred is a system for creating digital tokens, called 'Cred' (¤), for open-source projects. Cred represents credit for doing the work of developing and maintaining the project. For example, people who contribute to SourceCred's development will receive SourceCred¤.

The world benefits tremendously from open-source software, but most open-source developers don't get any recognition or reward. We want to build tools for fairly distributing Cred to those contributors, and incentives that act as rewards for having Cred. We hope these tools will reward open-source developers, and result in the creation of more open software.

SourceCred is in very early stages: as of 2/3/2018, we have just started work. Dandelion is currently working on an initial documentation push:

* **overview.md**

   high level overview for a general audience

* **cryptoeconomics.md**

   details on SourceCred's economic design, and precise token mechanics

* **implementation.md**

   implementation strategy and roadmap

We aim to have design discussions on GitHub, so that people who contribute to the design will receive Cred.
