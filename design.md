# SourceCred Design

## Design Goals
0. **Useful & Ethical**

   SourceCred is not a pie-in-the-sky project to design a theoretically ideal system. It is an attempt to empower the open-source community by building intuitive and useful software. As such, given the choice between the ideal and the attainable, we will choose the attainable.

   We also recognize that allocating credit is a weighty responsibility with diverse consequences. We will design the system with ethical integrity, to be empowering for individuals and communities while avoiding the potential centralization and abuse of power.

1. **Robust Incentives**

   SourceCred will generate robust incentives, so that rational actors trying to earn cred in a project will do so by making material contributions to the project's success and usefulness. The incentive system should be adaptable, so that as participants find ways to game them, communities can modify them to avoid incentive traps.

2. **Economic Value**

   SourceCred will provide a viable funding model for open-source projects. That means that the tokens it generates need to have some real economic value that is derived from the value of the project. Just creating a token and hoping speculators will buy it is not acceptable - the token needs to correspond to some real value for users of open-source software.

3. **Easy to Adopt**

   SourceCred needs to be able to meet the open-source community where it is today, and to be easy to adopt and use. Basic usage of SourceCred should feel intuitive and low friction, e.g. by using GitHub reactions and messages from GitHub bots as a low-resolution way of engaging with the system. We should ask users to learn new behaviors, like setting up an Ethereum address, only when we're already delivering lots of value - not as a prerequisite.

4. **Fork-friendly and Upgradable**

   Forking is an essential part of software development. SourceCred should enable forks with relatively low friction; users should not be locked into a single branch due to the difficulty of forking the cred allocation. Similarly, it should be easy for projects to upgrade to a newer version of SourceCred, or switch to a fork of SourceCred.
